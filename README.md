Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects Repository! 
Here, I compile a diverse collection of projects covering various domains such as healthcare, real estate, and more. Explore predictive models for heart diseases, cancer, Parkinson's, diabetes, home prices, and more. Each project offers valuable insights into data analysis and predictive modeling techniques.


In every project folder, you'll find a README file containing detailed descriptions of the project.
