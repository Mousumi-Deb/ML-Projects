# Predicting Bengaluru House Prices using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices in Bengaluru using machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, area in square feet, and other attributes that influence house prices in Bengaluru.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict house prices based on the available features. By leveraging historical house price data and employing various machine learning algorithms, we aim to develop a model that can provide valuable insights for real estate stakeholders, including buyers, sellers, and investors.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered data on house prices in Bengaluru, including features such as location, size, and amenities.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships between different features and the target variable (house prices).
4. **Feature Engineering**: Engineered new features and transformed existing ones to improve model performance.
5. **Model Selection**: Evaluated and selected appropriate machine learning algorithms for the prediction task. Commonly used models include Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines.
6. **Model Training**: Trained the selected machine learning models on the preprocessed data.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
8. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuned the hyperparameters of the best-performing models to optimize their performance further.
9. **Model Deployment**: Deployed the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## Technologies Used

- Python programming language
- Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn libraries for data manipulation and machine learning
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive data analysis and model development
- Flask or Streamlit for building a web application for house price prediction (optional)

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide valuable insights into Bengaluru's real estate market by predicting house prices accurately. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can empower stakeholders with data-driven decisions when buying, selling, or investing in properties in Bengaluru.
