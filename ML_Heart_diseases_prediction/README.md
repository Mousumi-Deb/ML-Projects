# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning techniques. Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment and prevention. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on relevant features.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Heart Disease UCI dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhagyashreebai/heart-diseases-uci) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains various attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, and other factors related to heart health.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is prepared for analysis by handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical ones, and scaling the features to ensure uniformity.

2. **Data Splitting**: The dataset is divided into two sets: one for training the model and the other for testing its performance. This step ensures the model is trained on a portion of the data and evaluated on unseen data to assess its generalization capability.

3. **Model Creation**: A logistic regression model is built using the training data. Logistic regression is a simple yet effective algorithm for binary classification tasks like predicting heart disease.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics help assess the model's performance in predicting heart disease accurately.

5. **Prediction System**: A system is developed using the trained model to predict the likelihood of heart disease for new individuals based on their attributes.

## Usage
To use this project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to execute each step of the project pipeline.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook or script to preprocess the data, train the logistic regression model, evaluate its performance, and create the predicting system.
4. Input new data into the predicting system to obtain predictions for heart disease.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## Results

The project achieves an accuracy score of 82% on the test set. This means that our model correctly predicts heart disease presence or absence 82% of the time on unseen data. This indicates that our model has a strong performance in distinguishing between individuals with and without heart disease, providing valuable insights for early diagnosis and intervention.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for predicting heart disease. By preprocessing the data, training a logistic regression model, and evaluating its performance, we can effectively classify patients based on their likelihood of having heart disease. Early detection of heart disease through predictive modeling has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality rates.
