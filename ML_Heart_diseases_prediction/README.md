# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning techniques. Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment and prevention. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on relevant features.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Heart Disease UCI dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhagyashreebai/heart-diseases-uci) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains various attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, and other factors related to heart health.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset used for training the model is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling. Data preprocessing techniques ensure that the input data is in a suitable format for machine learning algorithms.

2. **Data Splitting**: The preprocessed data is split into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the machine learning model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

3. **Model Creation**: Logistic Regression is chosen as the predictive model for this project due to its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in binary classification tasks.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained Logistic Regression model is evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Model evaluation helps assess the model's ability to correctly predict cancer cases.

5. **Predicting System**: Once the logistic regression model is trained and evaluated, a predicting system is created to allow users to input new data and obtain predictions regarding the presence or absence of cancer.

## Usage
To use this project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for predicting heart disease. By preprocessing the data, training a logistic regression model, and evaluating its performance, we can effectively classify patients based on their likelihood of having heart disease. Early detection of heart disease through predictive modeling has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality rates.
